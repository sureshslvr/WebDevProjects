# Basic Web Development Notes:

## 1. Tools for Coding
- **VS Code Extensions:**
  - **Live Server:** Shows your webpage updates instantly when you save.
  - **Prettier:** Automatically arranges your code to look neat and easy to read.

## 2. HTML Structure Basics
- Every HTML page starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` which tells the browser to expect an HTML5 document.
- An HTML document mainly contains **two parts**:
  - `<head>`: Hidden part for metadata, like page title and SEO info.
  - `<body>`: The visible part shown on the website.
- To quickly create a basic webpage in VS Code, type `!` or `html:5` and press Enter.

## 3. What Are Tags?
- Think of tags as special labels in **angled brackets `< >`** used to tell the browser how to display content.
- Tags usually come in pairs:
  - **Opening tag**: `<tagname>`
  - **Closing tag**: `</tagname>`
- Some tags are **self-closing**, meaning they don’t need a closing tag, like `<br>`, `<hr>`, and `<img>`.

## 4. Important Tags to Know
- **Headings:** `<h1>` to `<h6>`
  - `<h1>` is the biggest heading; `<h6>` is the smallest.
- **Paragraph:** `<p>` wraps blocks of text.
- **Text Style:**
  - `<b>` makes text bold.
  - `<i>` makes text italic.
- **Special Formatting:**
  - `<sup>` for superscript (e.g., 2<sup>2</sup> means 2 squared).
  - `<sub>` for subscript (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O).
- **Line Break:** `<br>` starts a new line without adding extra space like paragraphs.
- **Horizontal Line:** `<hr>` draws a dividing line.

## 5. Lists
- **Ordered List (`<ol>`):** Numbered list — each item inside `<li>`.
- **Unordered List (`<ul>`):** Bulleted list — each item inside `<li>`.

## 6. Metadata and SEO in `<head>`
- `<meta>` tags provide information such as page description and keywords to help search engines understand your page.
- The `<title>` tag sets the page’s name shown on the browser tab.

## 7. Learning Resources
- For detailed info, examples, and exploring new HTML tags, use [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org).
