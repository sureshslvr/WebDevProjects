flex box:
we have two main axises in flex
    1.column axis(cross axis)-y axis
    2.row/horizontal axis(main axis)-x axis

display:flex 
    to arrage the boxs in horizontal
align-items: flex-start 
    by defult it will be at starting only
align-items: center
    moves boxs to center column wise
align-items: center
    moves boxs to end of the column

justify-content: center
    to move boxes horizontal

by defult flex direction is row we can change it to column then x-axis(main axis) and y-axis(cross axis) will be interchanged

note: always remember flex properties should be applied for parent element only

border: 3px dotted white
    to apply border 

gap: 20px;
    to apply gap b/w the boxes

to avoid shrinking issues:
- we can add flex-wrap:wrap in parent so they will come in next line when the boxes reach parent limit
- or we can add flex-wrap:nowrap in parent and flex-shrink: 0 to arrage them in single row floating in browser 


task:
make amazon like carting using image and text unsing flex
